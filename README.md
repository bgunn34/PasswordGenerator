# PasswordGenerator
A simple app to generate a random password using user input parameters.

We have a working script, but there are a few things to do. 

1. Change the program so that when we answer one of the prompts yes, it requires at least one of that kind of char

2. Make an API that can be accessed from anywhere so that someone could use this script in a larger app.

Not bad for a few hours tho!
